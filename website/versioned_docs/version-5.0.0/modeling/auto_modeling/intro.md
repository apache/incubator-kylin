## Auto Modeling (Recommended)

Conventional modeling relies heavily on the data modelers' expertise. Powered by the recommendation engine, Kylin democratizes big data analytics with intelligent model and index building, as well as model optimization recommendations based on query history.

Kylin recommendation engine offers: 

- [Intelligent Modeling](data_modeling_by_SQL.md): Kylin recommendation engine will collect dimensions, measures and other critical information from your SQL statements, and then guide you through the modeling process. You do not need profound knowledge to build models that satisfy your needs, so you can focus more on your business.

- [Intelligent Index Optimization](optimize_index/intro.md): Indexes can help accelerate data queries. Kylin recommendation engine will generate recommendations based on business data characteristics and user queries to help precisely and efficiently optimize indexes. Kylin will also pre-compute data by loading it to indexes to quickly reduce query response times.
