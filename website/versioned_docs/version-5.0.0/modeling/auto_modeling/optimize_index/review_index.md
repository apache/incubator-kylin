In traditional model development mode, data modelers may need to frequently update indexes to reflect business changes. Kylin, powered by the recommendation engine, helps users flexibly adjust indexes with recommendations based on query history and source data characteristics to better handle their business needs.

   In this example, Kylin recommends adding an aggregate index. Click ![](../images/view.png)in the **Content** column to check the recommended dimensions and measures. If the recommendation type is **Delete**, you can check the reason in the **Note** column to evaluate whether to approve this recommendation.

5. Select the check box before the recommendation and click **Approve**. 

6. After adding the new index, you still need to build it so Kylin can help to accelerate queries with beforehand precomputations based on the index. 

   1. Click the **Index Overview** tab. 

   2. Find the index just created. Click ![](../images/build.png) in the **Actions** column.

   3. In the pop-up dialog box, select the check box before time range, and click **Build Index**. 

      To check the progress of the index building task, click **Monitor** > **Batch Job** in the left navigation panel.
