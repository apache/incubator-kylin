In a multi-tenant environment, sharing a large cluster securely requires each tenant to have allocated resources in a timely manner, within the constraints of their allocated capacities. To achieve this, each Kylin instance or project can be configured to utilize a separate YARN queue, enabling efficient computing resource allocation and separation.

### <span id="instance">Instance-level YARN Queue Setting</span>

To achieve this, first create a new YARN capacity scheduler queue. By default, the job sent out by Kylin will go to the default YARN queue.

In the screenshot below, a new YARN queue `learn_kylin` has been set up.

To configure the YARN queue used in Kylin, modify the `kylin.properties` file by replacing `YOUR_QUEUE_NAME` with the name of your YARN queue. This setting applies to both building and querying operations.

```shell
### Building configuration
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.yarn.queue=YOUR_QUEUE_NAME

### Querying configuration
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.yarn.queue=YOUR_QUEUE_NAME
```

In this example, the queue for querying has been changed to `learn_kylin` (as shown above). You can test this change by triggering a querying job.

Now, go to YARN Resource Manager on the cluster. You will see this job has been submitted under queue `learn_kylin`.

Similarly, you may set up YARN queue for other Kylin instances to achieve computing resource separation.



### <span id="project">Project-level YARN Queue Setting</span>

The system admin user can set the YARN Application Queue of the project in **Setting -> Advanced Settings -> YARN Application Queue**, please refer to the [Project Settings](../operations/project-managing/project_settings.md) for more information.
