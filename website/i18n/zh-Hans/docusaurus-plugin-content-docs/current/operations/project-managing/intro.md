The following sections introduce how to manage your projects in Kylin.

### <span id="about">What is a **「project」** in Kylin</span>

Project is the primary management unit of Kylin. In a project, you can design multiple models and perform query analysis.

System settings are isolated at the project level, so you can set different operational preferences for different projects.

Query is isolated at project level, which means models and tables in different projects cannot be queried in one SQL.
