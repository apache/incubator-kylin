The Kylin supports the integration of multiple data sources, such as Hive. You can connect different data sources to the platform and expose a unified query interface using Kylin, which shields the technical details of different data sources. It also creates a uniform business semantic layer that frees users from concerns about the technical complexity and implementation of the underlying data source.
