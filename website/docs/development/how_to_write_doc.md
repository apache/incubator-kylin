From Kylin 5.0, Kylin community proposed to write documents using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Please note multi-version and i18n(multi-language) is in our plan, but it is not supported right now.

### Shortcut: Edit a single existent page

:::caution
1. If you found some minor typos or mistakes on a **single** page, you can edit document in browser in this way in several minutes.
2. But if you want to add/edit **several** pages, upload images, or change global config files, please jump to next paragraph: [Before your work](#Before_your_work).
:::

1. Just scroll down the page to the bottom and click the `Edit this page`.

2. Edit this file in browser.

3. Raise a pull request for your changes.

### <span id="Before_your_work">Before your work</span>

Before you add new documentation, please deploy the document compilation environment.

There are two steps:

- [Install Node.js](#Install)
- [Clone Github Repo](#Download)

#### <span id="Install">Install Node.js</span>

First, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running node -v) is installed on your machine. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.

When installing Node.js via **Windows/macOS Installer**, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies. 

#### <span id="Download">Clone Github Repo</span>

1. Clone the doc repo to any path you prefer.

```shell
cd /path/you/prefer/to
git clone --branch doc5.0 https://github.com/apache/kylin.git # Or git clone -b doc5.0 https://github.com/apache/kylin.git
```

2. Install dependencies for prerequisite of doc. More about requirement about [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), please refer to [Docusaurus Installation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).
   
```shell
cd website
npm install
```

To check if that environment works well, run:

```shell
npm run start
```
   
then, homepage (`http://localhost:3000`) will automatically open in your default browser and no errors occurred.

### How to create new document

#### Step 1: Create a new markdown file with metadata

Create a new markdown file with editor, copy and paste following **Head metadata template** to the top your file. 
After that, replace actual literal with variable like `${TITLE OF NEW DOC}` etc.

```
---
title: ${TITLE OF NEW DOC}
language: en
sidebar_label: ${TITLE OF NEW DOC}
pagination_label: ${TITLE OF NEW DOC}
toc_min_heading_level: 2
toc_max_heading_level: 6
pagination_prev: null
pagination_next: null
keywords:
    - ${KEYWORD OF NEW DOC}
draft: false
last_update:
    date: ${DATE of YOUR COMMIT}
    author: ${YOUR FULL NAME}
---
```

:::caution 
Please note that each doc need the ___Head metadata___. More details about `Head metadata` of a doc, please refer to [Head metadata](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/head-metadata).
:::

#### Step 2: Add content for your new doc

Add text and pictures as you needs.

#### Step 3: Add new page to the sidebar

For example: if you want to add the sidebar of new doc(`how_to_write_doc.md`) to be the children menu of `development`.

Then, modify the `DevelopmentSideBar` block in `sidebars.js` and add a new block to the tail of `items` of `DevelopmentSideBar`.

```shell
DevelopmentSideBar: [
    {
        ...
        items: [
            {...},
            ...,
            {
                type: 'doc',
                id: 'development/how_to_write_doc.md'
            },
        ],
    },
],              
```


#### Step 4: Preview in your local machine
You can preview in your browser, please run following commands in the `website` directory, then access [doc5.0](http://127.0.0.1:3000) in your browser:

```
npm run start
```

:::caution Checklist
- [ ] Whether **look and feel** meet your expectation?
- [ ] Whether the link/pictures works fine?
- [ ] Whether the most important part was highlighted? You may [check this to highlight a paragraph](#highlight_paragraph).
:::

#### Step 5: Create a pull request
If everything is normal, create a pull request to [Apache Kylin Repo](https://github.com/apache/kylin) and target branch is `doc5.0`.
