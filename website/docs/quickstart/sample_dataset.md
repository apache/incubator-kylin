Kylin is embedded with a standard SSB dataset (approximately 5.9 MB) for testing or trying out different functions. This SSB dataset contains 5 tables and 1 view. LINEORDER serves as a central fact table with 60,175 rows of data. 

### Introduction

The following table lists the 5 tables and 1 view of SSB sample dataset.

| **Table**       | **Type**                 | **Description**                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LINEORDER**   | Fact table               | Contain detailed information about sales orders. Each row holds order information such as customer, supplier, order amount, and order date. |
| **P_LINEORDER** | View based on fact table | Contain details about sales orders and a pre-calculated row (V_REVENUE) with same transaction records as in LINEORDER. |
| **CUSTOMER**    | Dimension table          | Contain customer information, such as customer name, customer address, and customer city. |
| **SUPPLIER**    | Dimension table          | Contain supplier information, such as supplier name, supplier address, and supplier city. |
| **DATES**       | Dimension table          | Contain information about the dates of 7 years, such as beginning date of the year, beginning date of the month, and beginning date of the week. |
| **PART**        | Dimension table          | Contain part information, such as part name, part category, part color, and part type. |

The 5 tables together constitute the structure of the entire star data model. Below is an entity-relationship (E-R) diagram.

Join Relationships:

```sql
LINEORDER LEFT JOIN DATES ON LINEORDER.LO_ORDERDATE = DATES.D_DATEKEY
LINEORDER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER ON LINEORDER.LO_CUSTKEY = CUSTOMER.C_CUSTKEY
LINEORDER LEFT JOIN SUPPLIER ON LINEORDER.LO_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER.S_SUPPKEY
LINEORDER LEFT JOIN PART ON LINEORDER.LO_PARTKEY = PART.P_PARTKEY
```

### Import and check sample dataset

1. Log on to the server command line, and run the following command to import the SSB sample dataset: 

   ```shell
   $KYLIN_HOME/bin/sample.sh
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Replace `KYLIN_HOME` with the actual path of Kylin.

2. To check sample dataset:

   1. In the terminal, run `hive` command to enter Hive CLI.

   2. Run the following commands sequentially to check information about databases and tables. 

      ```sql
      ## List all databases
      show databases;
      ## Enter database SSB
      use ssb;
      ## List all tables in database SSB 
      show tables;
      ## Query the number of records in table SUPPLIER 
      select count(*) from SUPPLIER;
      ```
