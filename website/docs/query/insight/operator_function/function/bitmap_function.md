Users can use bitmap functions to operate de-duplication based on bitmap. Then find the intersection of the result bitmaps. 

Kylin supports following bitmap functions,



### Prerequisites

Kylin version is 5.0 or higher.
  	

### BITMAP_UUID

- Description

  - Return a string which points to a hidden serialized bitmap. The bitmap contains de-duplicated values and can be an input to other bitmap functions.

- Syntax

  - `bitmap_uuid(column_to_count)`
  
- Parameters

  - `column_to_count` ,  the column to be calculated and applied on distinct value, required to be added as **Precise count distinct** measure.
  
- Query Example 1

  ```select bitmap_uuid(SELLER_ID) from KYLIN_SALES where PART_DT=date'2012-01-01'```
  
- Response Example 1

  ![](images/bitmap_uuid.1.en.png)

  Return a string which points to a hidden serialized bitmap. The bitmap result is the de-duplicated seller id set of online transactions on New Year's Day. The bitmap can be used as an input to other bitmap functions.

### INTERSECT_BITMAP_UUID

- Description

  - Return a string which points to a hidden serialized bitmap. The bitmap contains the result of finding intersection based on filter column, and then de-duplicating based on count column. 

- Syntax

  - `intersect_bitmap_uuid(column_to_count,  column_to_filter, filter_value_list)`
  
- Parameters

  - `column_to_count` ,  the column to be calculated and applied on distinct value required to be added as **Precise count distinct** measure.
  - `column_to_filter`, the varied dimension. 
  - `filter_value_list`,  the value of the varied dimensions listed in `array[]`, When `column_to_filter` is of type varchar, A single element in an array can map multiple values. By default, the '|' is split. You can set `kylin.query.intersect.separator` in `kylin.properties` to configure the separator, Can take value '|' or ',', default is '|'(Currently this parameter does not support the use of subquery results as parameters).

> **Note:** When the data type of a varied dimension is not varchar or integer, the values in 'filter_value_list' need to be explicitly cast, for example:
> `select intersect_bitmap_uuid(column_to_count, column_to_filter, array[cast(3.53 as double), cast(5.79 as double)]) from ...`
> OR `select intersect_bitmap_uuid(column_to_count, column_to_filter, array[TIMESTAMP'2012-01-02 11:23:45', TIMESTAMP'2012-01-01 11:23:45']) from ...`

- Query Example 1

  LSTG_FORMAT_NAME is a column of VARCHAR(4096) varied dimension.
  
  ```
  select intersect_bitmap_uuid(
          SELLER_ID, LSTG_FORMAT_NAME,
          array['FP-GTC|FP-non GTC', 'Others'])
      from KYLIN_SALES
  ```
  
- Response Example 1

  ![](images/intersect_bitmap_uuid.1.en.png)
  
  Return a string which points to a hidden serialized bitmap. The bitmap result is the de-duplicated seller id set who have transactions in either type 'FP-GTC' and 'Others', or type 'FP-non GTC' or 'Others' on New Year's Day. The bitmap can be used as an input to other bitmap functions.

### INTERSECT_BITMAP_UUID_V2

- Description
  - Return a string which points to a hidden serialized bitmap. The bitmap contains the result of finding intersection based on filter column, and then de-duplicating based on count column. Support Regexp in condition.
- Syntax
  - `intersect_bitmap_uuid_v2(column_to_count,  column_to_filter, filter_value_list, filter_type)`
- Parameters
  - `column_to_count` ,  the column to be calculated and applied on distinct value required to be added as **Precise count distinct** measure.
  - `column_to_filter`, the varied dimension. 
  - `filter_value_list`,  the value of the varied dimensions listed in `array[]`,
  - `filter_type`, the data type is String, which identifies the filter mode. There are currently two optional values "RAWSTRING" and "REGEXP". When the parameter value is "RAWSTRING", the filtering mode is precise filtering. When `column_to_filter` is a Varchar type, A single element in the array can be mapped with multiple values. By default, it is separated by '|'. You can use `kylin.query.intersect.separator` to configure the separator. And only support configuration in the `kylin.properties` file.  (currently this parameter does not support using the results of subqueries as parameters). When the parameter value is "REGEXP", the filtering mode is regular matching, and only the value of the regular expression in column_to_filter that can match the filter_value_list will be filtered.

> **Note:**  When the filter_type is "RAWSTRING" and the data type of a varied dimension is not varchar or integer, the values in 'filter_value_list' need to be explicitly cast, for example:
> `select intersect_bitmap_uuid_v2(column_to_count, column_to_filter, array[cast(3.53 as double), cast(5.79 as double)], 'RAWSTRING') from TEST_TABLE`
> æˆ– `select intersect_bitmap_uuid_v2(column_to_count, column_to_filter, array[TIMESTAMP'2012-01-02 11:23:45', TIMESTAMP'2012-01-01 11:23:45'], 'RAWSTRING') from TEST_TABLE;`

- Query Example 1

  LSTG_FORMAT_NAME is a column of VARCHAR(4096) varied dimension.

  ```
  select intersect_bitmap_uuid_v2(
          SELLER_ID, LSTG_FORMAT_NAME,
          array['FP.*GTC', 'Other.*'], 'REGEXP')
      from KYLIN_SALES
  ```

- Response Example 1

  ![](images/intersect_bitmap_uuid2.1.en.png)

  Return a string which points to a hidden serialized bitmap. The regular expression can match 'FP-GTC', 'FP-non GTC' and 'Others', The bitmap result is the de-duplicated seller id set who have transactions in either type 'FP-GTC' and 'Others', or type 'FP-non GTC' or 'Others' on New Year's Day. The bitmap can be used as an input to other bitmap functions.

### INTERSECT_COUNT_BY_COL

- Description

  - Find the intersection of the serialized input bitmaps. Then return the distinct count.

- Syntax

  - `intersect_count_by_col(Array[t1.c1,t2.c2 ...])`
  
- Parameters

  - `t1.c1, t2.c2 ...`, the list of input columns. Each column points to a serialized bitmap hidden from users. Function `bitmap_uuid` and `intersect_bitmap_uuid`  and `intersect_bitmap_uuid_v2` can return the bitmap.
  
- Query Example 1

  ```
  select intersect_count_by_col(Array[t1.a1,t2.a2]) from
      (select bitmap_uuid(SELLER_ID) as a1
          from KYLIN_SALES) t1,
      (select intersect_bitmap_uuid(
          SELLER_ID, LSTG_FORMAT_NAME,
          array['FP-GTC|FP-non GTC', 'Others']) as a2
  from KYLIN_SALES) t2
  ```
  
- Response Example 1

  ![](images/intersect_count_by_col.1.en.png)
  
  Function `bitmap_uuid` and `intersect_bitmap_uuid` return two serialized bitmap. `intersect_count_by_col` then find the intersection on two bitmaps and return distinct count.

### Limitations
- All the above functions don't support pushdown query
