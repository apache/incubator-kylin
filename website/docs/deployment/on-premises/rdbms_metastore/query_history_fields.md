Starting with Kylin 5.0, the system uses RDBMS to store query history. And each metadata will store two tables related to query history:

- *query_history* : information for each query
- *query_history_realization* : each index that hit by query

### ***query_history*** table

| Field Name             | Description                                                         |

| engine_type            | four query objects, the blue name indicates the query hits model (index group), *HIVE* indicates that the query is pushed down to Hive, *CONSTANTS* indicates the query constant, and the blank indicates that the query failed. |
| error_type             | error message when error occurs during query execution                                         |

| query_first_day_of_week   | the initial time of the week in which the query time is located. This field is required when statistically querying the history by month         |
