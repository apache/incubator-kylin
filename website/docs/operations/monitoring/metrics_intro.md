By default, the system collects metric data every minute, including storage, query, job, metadata, and cleanup mechanism. The monitoring data is stored in the specified [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) and displayed through [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana). It can help administrators to understand the health of the system in order to take necessary actions.

> **Note**: Since Grafana depends on **InfluxDB**, please make sure that InfluxDB is correctly configured and started according to [Use InfluxDB as Time-Series Database](influxdb/influxdb.md) and download **Grafana** before you use Grafana.

```shell
# Download Grafana
$KYLIN_HOME/sbin/download-grafana.sh
```

> **Note**: The Grafana installation path, will be under the `grafana` directory in the installation directory of Kylin.


### <span id="grafana_startup">Grafana</span>

1. **Working Directory**: ``` $KYLIN_HOME/grafana```
2. **Configuration Directory**: ```$KYLIN_HOME/grafana/conf```
3. **Start Grafana Command**: ```$ KYLIN_HOME/bin/grafana.sh start```
4. **Stop Grafana Command**: ``` $ KYLIN_HOME/bin/grafana.sh stop```

> Changing grafana configuration please refer to [Configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/installation/configuration/).

After the startup is successful, you may access Grafana through web browser with default port: 3000, username: admin, password: admin

### <span id="dashboard">Dashboard</span>

Default Dashboard: ```Kylin 5.0```

The dashboard consists of 10 modules: Cluster, Summaries, Models, Queries, Favorites, Jobs, Cleanings, Metadata Operations, Transactions, among which Summaries module is automatically displayed in detail. Read more details about the modules, please refer to [Metrics Explanation](#explanation). If you want to make some changes for the dashboard, please refer to Grafana official website manual [Provisioning Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/administration/provisioning/). 

### <span id="panel">Panel</span>

Each indicator monitor corresponds to a specific panel.

### <span id="__interval">Time Range</span>

In the upper right corner of the dashboard, choose the time range. Time range: the time interval in which the indicator was observed.
![metrics_interval](images/interval.png)

### <span id="granularity">Data Granularity</span>

Located in the upper left corner of the dashboard, the data granularity: auto, 1m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, 6h, 12h, 1d, 7d, 14d, 30d ('auto' is automatically adjusted according to the time range, such as the time range '30min' corresponding granularity 5min, and the granularity corresponding to the time range of 24h is 4h).

> **Tip **: “Project related” in the following table indicates whether the metric is related to the project, “Y” indicates that the metric is related to the project, and “N” indicates that the metric is not related to the project. "Host related" in the following table indicates whether the metric is related to Kylin nodes, "Y" indicates that the metric is related to the Kylin nodes, "N" indicates that the metric is not related to the host. "all", "job", "query" is Kylin nodes' server mode.
