### [CVE-2020-13937](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13937)

__Severity__

Important

__Versions Affected__

Kylin 2.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.2.0, 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.5.0, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.6.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4, 2.6.5, 2.6.6, 3.0.0-alpha, 3.0.0-alpha2, 3.0.0-beta, 3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.0.2, 3.1.0, 4.0.0-alpha.

__Description__

Kylin has one restful api which exposed Kylin's configuration information without any authentication, so it is dangerous because some confidential information entries will be disclosed to everyone.

__Mitigation__

Users of all previous versions after 2.0 should upgrade to 3.1.0.

Users could edit `$KYLIN_HOME/WEB-INF/classes/kylinSecurity.xml`, and remove this line `<scr:intercept-url pattern="/api/admin/config" access="permitAll"/>`. After that,  restart all Kylin instances to make it effective.

Otherwise, you can upgrade Kylin to 3.1.1.

### [CVE-2020-13925](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13925)

__Severity__

Important

__Versions Affected__

Kylin 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.5.0, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.6.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4, 2.6.5, 2.6.6, 3.0.0-alpha, 3.0.0-alpha2, 3.0.0-beta, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 3.0.2

__Description__

Similar to CVE-2020-1956, Kylin has one more restful API which concatenates the API inputs into OS commands and then executes them on the server; while the reported API misses necessary input validation, which causes the hackers have the possibility to execute OS command remotely.

__Mitigation__

Users of all previous versions after 2.3 should upgrade to 3.1.0.
