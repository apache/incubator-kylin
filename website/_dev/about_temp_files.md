As we reviewed the code we found that Kylin left lots of garbage files in:

* Local file system of the CLI
* HDFS
* Local file system of the hadoop nodes.

A ticket was opened to track this issue:
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN-926](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN-926)

For future developments, please:

* Whenever you want to create temp files at Local, choose `File.createTempFile` or use the folder: `BatchConstants.CFG_KYLIN_LOCAL_TEMP_DIR(/tmp/kylin)`, do not randomly use another folder in `/tmp`, it will end up a mess, and look unprofessional.
* Whenever you create temp files at Local, remember to delete it after using it. It's best to use `FileUtils.forceDelete`, as it also works for deleting folders. Try avoid `deleteOnExit`, in case Kylin exits abnormally.
* Whenever you want to create files in HDFS, try to create it under `kylin.hdfs.working.dir` or `BatchConstants.CFG_KYLIN_HDFS_TEMP_DIR`, and remember to delete it after it is no longer useful. Try avoid throwing everything into hdfs:///tmp and leave it as garbage.
